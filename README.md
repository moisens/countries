# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher

![desktop-preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54061750/137177993-e4d47206-d36e-4408-b48e-30972356b701.jpg)

 The challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries V2 API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as [React](https://reactjs.org) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org). You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*
